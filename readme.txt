## Usage
1. Install these modules:
   - `pip install pygame`
   - `pip install pynput`
   - `pip install opencv-python`
2. Ensure your webcam is connected and working; if it isn't the case, it will still work.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python script.pyw` or double-click on the file, and it should open in hidden mode.
4. Type something or click to trigger captures, sound alerts, and screen locking.

## Configuration
- Adjust the `SOUND_FILE` variable to change the sound alert file path.
- Modify the `PHOTO_FOLDER` variable to set the folder for captured photos.
- Customize the `CAPTURE_COUNT_THRESHOLD` to determine how many times the keyboard + mouse should be triggered to lock the screen (default = 4).
- Modify the `quit_program_key` variable to set the key to quit the program (default = page_up).
